## **Introduction**
Traditional methods for analyzing student performance are manual and have limited scalability and real-time capabilities.  
Our solution leverages AWS cloud services to create a **cloud-based machine learning pipeline** that predicts student academic performance for early intervention.  

**Business Impact:**  
- Enables personalized learning  
- Supports proactive interventions to improve student outcomes  

---

## **Project Goals**
1. **Create Scalable Pipeline** – Implement end-to-end AWS architecture for data processing  
2. **Ensure Cost Efficiency** – Leverage serverless AWS services to minimize operational costs  
3. **Build Hybrid Ensemble Model** – Combine Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks  
4. **Develop User-Friendly Interface** – Deploy Streamlit web application for real-time predictions

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)  
- **Records:** 395 students, 32 features  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographic: Gender, age (15–22)  
  - Socioeconomic: Parent education, occupation  
  - Behavioral: Study time, absences, alcohol use  
  - Academic: G1, G2, final grade (G3)  
- **Target Variable:** G3 binned into Low (0–9), Medium (10–14), High (15–20)  

---

## **Data Preprocessing**
- Label Encoding for categorical features  
- Normalization for numerical features  
- Train-Test Split (80% train / 20% test)
